# Support Doc QA Checklist

- [ ] Ensure Markdown linter is passing.
    - If the Markdown linter is failing, correct the mistakes or disable bad lints until it's passing.
    - (Bad lints are those that prevent the rendered content from being formatted as desired.)
- [ ] Spelling: Copy/paste contents into LibreOffice Writer & run spell check.
- [ ] Grammar: Read through article, ensure English grammar is proper.
    - Look into Grammarly if we see inconsistency on this?
- [ ] Links: Ensure all hyperlinks within the article work.
- [ ] Accuracy of instruction: Ensure any step-by-step instructions work.
- [ ] Accuracy of advice: Read through article, ensure any general statements or assertions are correct.
- [ ] Quality of images: Ensure screenshots use default desktop wallpapers and are clearly labeled, if applicable.
- [ ] Consistency: Ensure formatting, perspective, and tense are consistent within the article.

This checklist is an objective starting point for QA review; other topics (such as conciseness or clarity of wording) can also be raised in a review.
