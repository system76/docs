### New Features

#### Pop Shell Automatic Window Tiling
Pop!\_OS 20.04 features automatic window tiling. To activate tiling mode, click the tiling menu icon at the top right of the screen and toggle on Tile Windows. Open and newly launched windows will be automatically tiled. Toggling off Tile Windows will revert to floating mode. Click the tiling menu icon again and choose Keyboard Shortcuts. This help application will show you how to navigate, move, and resize windows all with your keyboard.

#### New Application Switcher and Launcher
Type `Super` + `/` to activate the new application switcher and launcher. Instead of `Super` + `Tabbing` through application icons, simply type `Super` + `/` and start typing the name of the application you want to switch to or launch.

#### Flatpak support with the Flathub
Pop!\_Shop now includes Flatpak application support and the Flathub application repository by default. The source of applications is visible when viewing application details. System76 continues to curate and package key applications such as Steam, Atom, and VS Code. Pop!\_OS repositories are prioritized to provide the best user experience for these applications.

#### Hybrid Graphics
Customers with integrated and discrete graphics can now choose Hybrid Graphics from the battery section of the user menu. While in Hybrid Graphics mode, right clicking an application in the Activities overview offers a "Launch Using Dedicated Graphics Card" option. This enables customers to use battery-saving integrated graphics while launching specific apps on the dedicated GPU.

#### Offline Upgrades
Version upgrades allow you to download the upgrade in the background and then apply it offline when you’re ready to perform the upgrade.

#### Application Indicators in Top Bar
Application indicators are now present at the top right of the desktop by default.

#### More Accessible Pop!\_Picks
Pop!\_Shop now loads up to 20 Pop!\_Picks making highlighted applications more accessible. These are curated and preferred applications tested to provide the best experience.

#### Theme Updates
Dark mode is enabled by default. Default desktop wallpaper has a new design. Both defaults can be changed within the Appearance settings.
