From toys to medicine, manufacturing today is highly dependent on oil-based 
resource extraction. Motivated to find a more sustainable way, the Novo 
Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain) at the 
Technical University of Denmark is developing new technologies in which 
chemicals are produced biologically.

Moritz Beber, a Postdoctoral Fellow at DTU Biosustain, is part of the 
computer-aided design team who are currently researching ways to translate 
these biotechnological projects from academia to industrial applications. 
Moritz depends on Linux hardware and software from System76 to streamline 
his work.

> “I have been running Linux since I was sixteen years old. I’ve used many 
> different distros over the years. Today, I use Ubuntu and Pop!_OS. I love 
> what System76 has done with Pop! It’s fast and snappy, and it saves me time, 
> with decrypt to login taking only seconds. I really appreciate that.
>
> I have Pop! on a System76 laptop that’s a few years old, and it is noticeably 
> faster than new hardware with other operating systems that I’ve used in the 
> lab.”

Moritz’s primary role at DTU Biosustain is contributing to the project 
DD-DeCaF (Bioinformatics Services for Data-Driven Design of Cell Factories 
and Communities). The project brings together leading European research 
universities and industry partners.

The academic partners are developing cutting-edge methods for using large 
scale data to design cell factories and communities for biotechnological 
applications. The role of the team at DTU is to coordinate those efforts 
and integrate them in an online platform called Caffeine. This tool can be 
used by non-experts to intuitively design metabolic networks in their 
browser. The usefulness of those methods is evaluated by industry partners.

> “Our team is building an accessible software platform for lab biologists 
> doing metabolic engineering. The tools have been available but you needed to 
> be a programmer to use them. Our lab also does robotics and lab automation, 
> including projects like customizing protocols for pipetting robots.”

Moritz uses a variety of open source programs during the work day, such as 
vim, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, tmux, and Oh My ZSH. Moritz is an active 
contributor and maintainer in several open source communities.

> “I maintain Python libraries for cobrapy and cameo, which are tools for 
> metabolic modeling and engineering. It’s exciting to see the growing 
> community for these projects on GitHub and Gitter.”

In addition to their local machines, Moritz’s team uses microservices 
architecture through Google Cloud with a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, 
continuous integration and delivery via Travis CI, and the university’s 
two High-Performance Computing Clusters (HPCCs) that run Scientific Linux.

Linux thrives in these types of hybrid computing environments, from HPCCs 
all the way down to single board computers like a BeagleBone or Raspberry 
Pi. Connect with the System76 team today to learn about the company’s 
laptop, desktop, and server solutions and how they can accelerate your 
team’s work in bioinformatics and beyond.
