  ## Install
  ### ubuntu
  
-  Install Dependencies for Ubuntu
  
      sudo apt-get install nodejs git build-essential python2.7
      
 -  Next, Clone the repo and build!
   
        git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns.git cjdns\
        ./do
        
-  Now, check  bash``` ./cjdroute```
  
-  Make sure you got the swag.
  
        LANG=C cat /dev/net/tun

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state` Good!

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: No such file or directory`, create it using:

    sudo mkdir -p /dev/net &&
    sudo mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200 &&
    sudo chmod 0666 /dev/net/tun
      
      After a little wait, the build should finish successfully. Now we want to configure cjdns to run as a daemon, so letâ€™s create a link to the binary, generate a configuration file, and copy over the service file.

        ln -s /opt/cjdns/cjdroute /usr/bin
        (umask 077 && ./cjdroute --genconf > /etc/cjdroute.conf)
        cp contrib/systemd/cjdns.service /etc/systemd/system/
        
        Now that we have that, we can configure it in nano /etc/cjdroute.conf and enable it for automatic start on boot.

               systemctl enable cjdns
        systemctl start cjdns
      
      You will connect automatically with wifi, but you can peer over the internet too!
