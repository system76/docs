The GNOME desktop environment is highly customizable.  With a few extensions, the desktop can look and feel like many other operating system's desktops.  Launcher bars can be added, window lists can be used, and the overall look and feel of the desktop can be changed.

To install a customization, simply head to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org) to install, remove, and configure currently installed customizations.  A web browser plugin is needed to interact with the site, and it will prompt for installation if needed.  Remember to refresh the page after the plugin is installed.

We will share some of the more popular extensions, but there are many more to choose from!  If one is found and it isn't currently working, or breaks with an update, then try a different extension to see if it works better.

### Appindicator Support and TopIcons Plus

[Appindicator Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/)  
[Top Icons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/)  

![topicons](/images/customize-gnome/topicons.png)

Appindicator Support and TopIcons Plus both serve to add the ability for programs to use an indicator icon to show they are running.  This functionality has been removed in recent versions of GNOME, and an extension is needed for the functionality.  These 2 programs work slightly differently, and work better in some setups vs. others.  If one doesn't work, try the other one.

See [blogs.gnome.org](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2017/08/31/status-icons-and-gnome/) for more background on the removal of the support from default GNOME environment.
