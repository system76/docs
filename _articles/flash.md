To watch Flash videos with <u>Firefox</u>, <u>Chromium</u>, and <u>Opera</u>, we recommend using <u>Pepperflash</u>, rather than <u>Adobe Flash</u>, for security reasons.  <u>Pepperflash</u> is maintained by Google and included in the <u>Chrome</u> browser by default, and can be downloaded separately to be used in other browsers.  Please run this command to install <u>Pepperflash</u>:

```
sudo apt install browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash
```

Otherwise, to install <u>Google Chrome</u>, follow these instructions:

### Download Chrome

First, you'll need to [download Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Click the **Download Chrome** button:

When prompted, enter your password and wait for the installation to finish. When it's complete, the **Install** button will say **Uninstall** instead:

If <u>Eddy</u> isn't working, re-download <u>Chrome</u> and choose **Save File** to the `Downloads` folder, and then run these commands:

```
sudo apt install ~/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt -f install
```

#### In Ubuntu

After you select **64-bit .deb (For Debian/Ubuntu)** option, then click **Accept and Install**.
