GRUB is the Ubuntu bootloader. It takes care of getting the operating system started up. It is also responsible for allowing the user to select between multiple operating systems at boot. Sometimes, GRUB can begin acting funny, and it may not let you boot into Ubuntu to fix the problem.

### Important Note About GRUB Updates!

If you need to configure grub-pc (for example, after an update), installing grub to all devices will break GRUB. You will need to install to /dev/sda (_not_ /dev/sda1) **only**. Installing everywhere **will** break the bootloader.

## 1. Create an Ubuntu Live Disk

## 2. Reinstall GRUB Bootloader

Once you have the disk made, reboot your system. You'll need to tell the computer to boot from the Live Disk. When you see the System76 logo on the screen:

Laptops  | Desktops
-------- | --------
Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> | Hold <kbd>F8</kbd> or <kbd>F10</kbd>

Open a terminal  (search _Terminal_ from the Ubuntu dash or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and run the following commands:

`lsblk`

and

`blkid`

And then look for the name of your main hard drive. It could be `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1p1`, depending on if you have a standard SATA drive, or an NVMe drive. Pay attention to the sizes of the partitons if you have multiple drives, and look for the [SWAP] partition to help identify the main OS partition. Make sure to use `/dev/sda1` (the partition) and `/dev/sda` (the disk) in the following commands, or `/dev/nvme0n1p1` (the partition) and `/dev/nvme0n1` (the disk), depending on your hardware.

Run these only if you have an NVMe drive:

```
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi
```

And then continue with these commands for both types of drives:

```
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
sudo chroot /mnt
grub-install /dev/sda
sudo update-grub
```

After this, reboot your computer, removing the disk when prompted, and Ubuntu should boot.

### Common Errors

Often, the fourth command (`sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf`) will return an error, stating that the file does not exist. This is not an issue, and you can proceed. Alternatively, connecting to the internet from the LiveCD should create this file.

If the chroot command returns with the error "chroot: cannot run command `/bin/bash': Exec format error", this probably indicates that the Ubuntu Install CD is not compatible with that of the installed system.

For example, the error is most frequently seen when trying to chroot to a 64-bit system (eg. amd64) from a 32-bit Install CD (eg. x86).

The solution is to use an Install CD which is using the same architecture as the installed system (i.e. 32-bit Install CD for 32-bit targets / 64-bit Install CD for 64-bit targets).
