4. At the _BIOS Flash Update_ menu, select the USB device and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

5. Select the `meer1-0358.bio` file and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

6. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again to confirm that you want to update the BIOS.

   _The BIOS will now update. This may take 2–5 minutes to complete. Please wait, and **do not turn the system off** until the update has completed._
