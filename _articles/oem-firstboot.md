A lot of work goes in to making your System76 experience fantastic right out of the box. Getting running needs just a little bit of information like a username and password. Every now and then, something goes wrong with the new user creator. If you boot your computer and only find a Guest Session, follow these instructions to create a new user manually.

# Overview

Here are the general steps for creating a user manually:

1. Reboot into Recovery Mode
2. Log in to a root shell
3. Mount your OS drive as read-write
4. Create a new user
5. Associate the new user default system groups
6. Reboot normally
7. Send logs to System76 to help us track this down

## Boot into Recovery Mode

Power on (or reboot) your system. Hold the left <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, or start pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> to get to the GRUB boot menu.

If you end up at the GRUB CLI (it looks like `grub >`) type _exit_, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> and then immediately press <kbd>ESC</kbd> twice.

Once you're in the GRUB boot menu, choose **Advanced options for Ubuntu** and then **recovery mode.** The system will boot into the recovery menu.

Choose `root`, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to get started.

## Creating a new user

Once you're at the root shell (identified with the prompt `root@ubuntu:~#`), enter the commands below one at a time, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> after each command.

_Note that in this example, we're creating the user **tom.** Replace **tom** with your desired username._

```
mount -o rw,remount /
adduser tom
usermod -a -G adm,cdrom,sudo,dip,plugdev,lpadmin,sambashare tom
exit
```

`adduser` will ask for a lot of information, like full name, room number, phone number, etc. -- It's not necessary to provide anything other than Password and Full Name.

Once you're back at the recovery menu, choose `resume` to resume normal boot.

## Help us track down the problem

Lastly, we need your help in tracking down this bug. When you get logged in, open a terminal and run this command, then send us the 'log.tgz' file it creates.

`sudo tar -cvz -f ~/log.tgz /var/log`

Please open a Support ticket and attach the log file.
