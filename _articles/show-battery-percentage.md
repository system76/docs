To show the battery percentage in the top bar in Pop!\_OS, you will need to use the GNOME Tweak Tool.

### Installing the GNOME Tweak Tool
To get started with showing the battery percentage, you need to install the GNOME Tweak Tool using the following command:
```shell
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
```

Once it is installed, open it up.

### Showing the battery percentage
In the GNOME Tweak Tool, navigate to the "Top Bar" section, and toggle the "Battery Percentage" on.
