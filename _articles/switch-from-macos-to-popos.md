Pop!\_OS offers corresponding workflows and applications to those available in macOS. Users will find UI elements where they expect them to be as well as some additional features.

#[Navigation](#navigation)

## [Finding Programs and Files](#finding-programs-and-files)

**macOS**
- Spotlight Search

![search](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/search.png)

On macOS, Spotlight Search can be launched by clicking the magnifying glass in the upper right-hand corner of the screen, or by pressing CMD+SPACE.
In Pop!\_OS, clicking on the "Activities" menu in the upper left-hand corner of the screen opens the Activities Overview. Overview has a search bar situated in the top-center of the screen which will search file names and applications.

**Pop!\_OS**
- Activities Overview

![activities-overview](/images/pop-os-screenshots/activities-pop-os.png)

The Activities Overview screen can also be launched by pressing the SUPER key. Once Overview is launched, users can begin typing to search their computer.

## [Application Shortcuts](#application-shortcuts)

**macOS**
  - Dock

**Pop!\_OS**
  - Dock

In both macOS and Pop!\_OS, a tray of application shortcuts is provided for convenience.

In both OSes this is referred to as the "Dock." Icons show additional indicators when an app is open (a dot next to the icon) and favorite applications can be saved to the Dock for easy access.

The Dock is located on the Left side of the screen, vertically, in Pop!\_OS.
macOS' default is to place the Dock at the bottom of the screen.

The Dock can be moved in both OSes. macOS has this feature in System Preferences; Pop!\_OS accomplishes this change with a GNOME extension.

For more information on GNOME extensions, refer to the following support articles:
[Customize Pop!\_OS](https://support.system76.com/articles/customize-gnome/)
[Dock Customization](https://support.system76.com/articles/dash-to-dock/)

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [View Installed applications](#view-installed-applications)

**macOS**
  - Launchpad


Both macOS and Pop!\_OS have a method for showing installed applications in an icon grid.

In macOS this feature is called Launchpad and is represented by the rocket-ship icon.

**Pop!\_OS**
  - Show Applications

![launchpad-show-applications](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/launchpad-show-applications.png)


In Pop!\_OS, the apps overview can be shown by clicking on the icon resembling a grid of dots in the lower-left of the screen at the bottom of the dock. This is the "Show Applications" icon.

  [Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [Install and Manage Software](#install-and-manage-software)

**macOS**
  - App Store
  - .dmg Files



  In macOS applications are installed from two (2) main sources. The Apple App Store, and directly from developer websites.

  Applications downloaded and installed from the internet make use of .dmg files or .pkg files which run installer programs and guide users in moving Applications to the Applications folder.

**Pop!_OS**
  - Pop!\_Shop
  - .deb Files
  - flatpaks


![appstore-popshop](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/appstore-popshop.png)


In Pop!\_OS. The Pop!\_Shop functions as an app store. The Pop!\_Shop highlights popular applications and lets users install them with a click and password authentication.

Debian/Ubuntu based distributions like Pop!\_OS can install applications from .deb files. These files function like .dmg files on macOS; opening a downloaded .deb file launches the installer program "Eddy" and puts the installed application in the correct folder.

Since 20.04, The Pop!\_Shop has offered the ability to install flatpak versions of apps instead of, or alongside .deb files. Flatpaks are self-contained (or containerized) versions of apps that hold everything that program needs in one package. This allows users to run multiple versions of an application, and for the application to be sand-boxed from the main OS.

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


### [Application Folders](#application-folders)

  One key difference between macOS and Pop!\_OS is how and where applications are installed. in macOS, with a few exceptions, all installed applications go into a dedicated folder located under the /Applications folder. Applications are self-contained items and can be moved or deleted by acting on the file for the application itself.

  In Pop!\_OS, and other Ubuntu-based distributions, there are certain parts of applications that are referenced by other applications and are installed separately. These smaller applications and parts of applications are called libraries or dependencies. Due to this structure of software installation, and depending on how a program is installed, it may be stored in one of a few locations.

  ~/.local/share/applications

  /usr/share/applications

  /usr/bin

  /opt/

The placement of applications in Pop!\_OS is handled transparently by the operating system. Users don't need to memorize these locations or, in most cases, modify them in any way. They are provided here for reference purposes.

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [Workspaces and Window Management](#workspaces-and-window-management)

Both macOS and Pop!\_OS use workspaces to organize open application windows

![workspaces-overivew-activities-overview](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/workspaces-activites-overview.png)

macOS uses multi-touch gestures, or CTRL+[up arrow] or [down arrow], to launch "Mission Control" and CTRL+[left arrow] or [right arrow] are used to navigate between workspaces.

In Pop!\_OS users press the SUPER key to enter "Overview" and show all workspaces. They can also use CTRL+SUPER+[up arrow] or [down arrow] to navigate between workspaces.


[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


### [Pop Shell](#pop-shell)

Starting in version 20.04, Pop!\_OS now includes a tiling window-manager as a GNOME extension. The window manager is called pop-shell, and allows for window organization and keyboard navigation among windows and applications.

More info about Pop!\_Shell here:

[Pop!\_OS 20.04 Release Notes](https://support.system76.com/articles/Pop!_OS-20.04-LTS-Release-Notes/)

[Pop-Shell Keyboard Shortcuts](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-keyboard-shortcuts/)


[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [File Management](#file-management)

The file-systems layouts in macOS and Pop!\_OS both feature location shortcuts on the left side, tabbed browsing, list vs. icon views, and various sorting options.

**Apple**
     - Finder


 In macOS, Finder displays files and directories (folders), and is represented by the two-tone, blue face icon in the dock.


**Pop!\_OS**
     - Files


 In Pop!\_OS, the Files application serves the same purpose. It is represented by a gray icon that looks like a tabbed folder from a filing cabinet.

![files-finder](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/files-edited.png)

 [Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [Light Mode vs. Dark Mode](#light-mode-vs-dark-mode)

As of macOS 10.14 (Mojave), users have the option of using a default "dark mode" for the look and feel of their OS.

Pop!\_OS has had a dark mode since 19.10. There were dark mode options available previously, but the official "Dark Mode" of Pop!\_OS was added in Pop!\_OS 19.10.

Dark Mode can be enabled by visiting

Settings>Appearance>Appearance(Tab)>Dark (Radio button)

![appearance-settings](/images/pop-os-screenshots/appearance-settings.png)

# [Software](#software)

## [Web Browsing and Password Management](#web-browsing-and-password-management)

**macOS**
  - Safari (Default)

**Pop\_OS**
  - Firefox (Default)

  The default web browser in macOS is Safari. Pop!\_OS features the Firefox browser.

  Both Safari and Firefox offer privacy features like "do not track" requests, other blockers, and customizeable search-engine defaults.

  Users accustomed to using Apple Pay or iCloud Keychain for payments and password management will require workflow adjustments, as these are Apple proprietary   services.

  There are cross-platform password managers available, which offer the option to save and auto-fill payment methods.

  Most modern browsers offer the ability to create an account that will save and sync user logins.

Examples include:

- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) (Terminal app or Browser Extension)
- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)

![bitwarden](/images/pop-os-screenshots/bitwarden.png)

**Other Browser Options**
  - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) (available in the Pop!\_Shop)
  - [Brave](https://brave.com/)

For users accustomed to Chrome, Chrome is available for Linux, as well as Chrome-based alternative options like Chromium and Brave.

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)


## [Office Work](#office-work)
**macOS**
  - Pages/Numbers/Keynote (iWork)


The software suite formerly known as "iWork" contains Apple's equivalent to Microsoft Office. It contains Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets) and Keynote (presentations). These apps are all capable of reading and saving files in outside formats like those used in Microsoft Office, but by default, they save files in formats specific to the iWorks suite: .pages, .numbers, and .keynote respectively.


**Pop!\_OS**
  - [Writer/Calc/Impress (LibreOffice)](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

![libreoffice-icons](/images/pop-os-screenshots/libreoffice-icons.png)

![libreoffice-windows-open](/images/pop-os-screenshots/libreoffice-windows-open.png)

  Pop!\_OS comes with the open-source office suite LibreOffice installed by default. LibreOffice can open Microsoft Office files, and export to Office formats (.docx, etc.). LibreOffice cannot open iWork formatted projects. For example, documents ending in .pages will need saved in a different format before LibreOffice will open them. LibreOffice saves documents in the .odt format by default.

**Other**
- [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/)

If exporting iWork files is not an option, users can also visit iCloud.com in a web browser and use the web-based versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote. However, an Apple ID is required (free).

- [Office365 Online](https://www.office.com/)

Microsoft offers in-browser versions of the Microsoft Office suite as part of Office365. Those with subscriptions can access Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Teams, Outlook and others. In most cases, there's no need to install Windows to access Microsoft Office apps.

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)

## [Calls and Video Chat](#calls-and-video-chat)

Pop!\_OS does not offer a default messaging app. The preference is that users choose their own and install only what they need/want.
However, many popular 3rd-party applications have Linux versions available.

Recommendations provided here are suggestions for open-source alternatives.

**macOS**
     - FaceTime/iMessage


For video and instant messaging, macOS provides FaceTime and iMessage. Both of these applications are Apple exclusive, and require an Apple ID to use most of the features.

**Pop!\_OS**
Chat
  - [Element](https://element.io/) (Formerly Riot.im)
  - [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) (also available in the Pop!\_Shop)
  - [Slack](https://slack.com/) (also available in the Pop!\_Shop)

Element (formerly Riot.im) is an open-source instant messaging client which makes use of the matrix network. The client offers end-to-end encryption, multiple chat rooms and communities, and can be used on the decentralized matrix network or self-hosted. It offers integrations with other applications and platforms like IRC, Slack, and Jitsi.

Linux versions of Slack and its open-source alternative Mattermost are available in Pop!\_Shop.

![geary](/images/pop-os-screenshots/geary.png)


For users more accustomed to Microsoft Outlook, there's an alternative, open-source program by Mozilla called Thunderbird which supports calendar integration and similar organization features to Outlook.


![thunderbird](/images/pop-os-screenshots/thunderbird.png)

**NOTE:** Regardless of platform or client, many email accounts (e.g. Google) have implemented a security policy where a single-use password must be created for each email app users want to sync with their account. These passwords have to be created from the email provider's account website.

**Other Options**
  - [Outlook Web](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)
  - Webmail (in General)

Microsoft also offers a web-based version of Outlook mail which can be accessed from a web browser.

# [System Management](#system-management)

## [Kill Programs](#kill-programs)

**macOS**
  - Force Quit (default)
  - Activity Monitor (default)

On macOS there are two main ways to kill unresponsive programs. The force-quit menu and the Activity Monitor application.

![force-quit-activity-monitor](/images/macOS-Screenshots/force-quit-activity-monitor.png)

Force-quit is launched by clicking on the Apple menu in the upper-left-hand corner of the screen, or by pressing Opt+Cmd+Esc, selecting the application, and then "force-quit."

Users can also get an overview of running processes and stop or kill them from the Activity Monitor.

It is also possible to kill processes in the Terminal if process ID is known.

**Pop!\_OS**
  - System Monitor (default)
  - Terminal (default)

![system-monitor-terminal](/images/pop-os-screenshots/system-monitor-terminal.png)

Pop!\_OS also has options for killing misbehaving processes. System Monitor (equivalent to Activity Monitor), displays running processes and allows users to stop or kill them.

While Pop!\_OS does not have a force-quit menu, when applications freeze, the OS will show a pop-up window asking if users want to wait on the program or force-quit it.

The same Terminal commands available in macOS can also be used in Pop!\_OS.

Running the command:

    top

will show a similar output to what's displayed in the System Monitor.

Once the offending process' Process ID (PID) is known (either from System Monitor or the Terminal) the process can be killed with the terminal command:

    sudo kill -pid ####

## [Networking](#networking)

**macOS**
- System Preferences

**Pop!\_OS**
- Settings

![network-setting-pop-mac](/images/pop-os-mac-screenshots/network-settings-pop-mac.png)


macOS and Pop!\_OS manage network menus and settings almost identically. Both have a drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the screen to quickly connect to an available network.

Both have dedicated areas in System Preferences (macOS) and Settings (Pop!\_OS) to edit saved connections, IP settings, and to configure things like proxy settings or Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)

## [Disk Encryption](#disk-encryption)


**macOS**
- Filevault

**Pop!\_OS**

- LUKS (during Install)

![encryption-pop](/images/install-pop/5_encrypt_notice-cropped.png)

On Pop!\_OS, encryption is offered during initial setup, or a reinstall. The OS partition is encrypted using the LUKS disk layout. This tool adds a decryption screen so that every time the computer boots, it requires a decryption password before moving to the login screen. With an encrypted drive, if hardware is stolen, the only way to remove the encryption is to erase the disk.

**NOTE:** Because of the way encryption is implemented on Pop!\_OS, and the delicate work involved in encrypting or decrypting the drive, encryption is only offered during intial set up. If users choose not to use encryption, and want to add it later, it will require a full erase and reinstall. Create backups accordingly.

[Return to Table of Contents](#Contents)

## [System Backups](#system-backups)

**macOS**
- Time Machine


**Pop!\_OS**
- [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift) (available in the Pop!\_Shop)
- [Déjà Dup Backups](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DejaDup) (available in the Pop!\_Shop)

![pop-backups](/images/pop-os-screenshots/pop-backups.png)

In the interest of user-choice, Pop!\_OS does not have a built in backup utility, but several applications are available to choose from in the Pop!\_Shop. The two (2) featured here are Timeshift (pictured left) and Déjà Dup Backups (pictured right).

Timeshift is designed to capture snapshots and restore points of the system at a given time and is only compatible with backing up a Linux system to another Linux formatted drive.
The snapshot feature is comparable to snapshots offered by virtual machine managers.

Déjà Dup Backups is closer in functionality to Time Machine. It offers local hardware backups, or backups to network locations. Folders and files can be added to the backup list manually, and it backs up the Home folder by default. Automatic backups can also be run on a schedule.
