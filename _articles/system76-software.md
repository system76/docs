# Notes about these instructions

NOTE: These instructions were tested on a Galago Pro (galp3-b) and Pangolin (pang10). Neither system have NVIDIA GPUs, so this process doesn't go over installing the NVIDIA driver (system76-driver-nvidia). Due to these limitations, switchable graphics may not work on NVIDIA systems.

## Arch

Be sure to install the <u>System76 Driver</u> first. The steps to do that are [here](/articles/system76-driver). 

### System76 Firmware Daemon

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-firmware.git
cd system76-firmware-daemon
makepkg -srcif
sudo systemctl enable --now system76-firmware-daemon
sudo gpasswd -a $USER adm
```

### System76 Firmware Manager

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/firmware-manager.git
cd firmware-manager
makepkg -srcif
```

### System76 DKMS

This package is needed for hotkeys and fan(s) on Closed Firmware systems:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-dkms.git
cd system76-dkms
makepkg -srcif
```

### System76 ACPI DKMS

This package is needed for hotkeys and fan(s) on Open Firmware systems:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-acpi-dkms.git
cd system76-acpi-dkms
makepkg -srcif
```

### System76 Power

```bash

```

NOTE: This package is only needed for Thelio desktops.

### System76 OLED 

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-oled.git
cd system76-acpi-oled
