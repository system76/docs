## Getting to Know the Ubuntu Desktop

Use the *Launcher* on the left hand side of the screen to start your favorite apps. You can switch between running apps by clicking on their icons. Right click on an icon in the Launcher to show a menu of actions. Actions include adding, removing application icons, opening new tabs, switching multiple windows of the same app and much more.

Use the *Menu Bar* at the top of the screen to view options like *File, Edit, View* for the current application window you're working in. You can Mouse over the Menu Bar to see the drop-down menu.

*Window controls* are on the left of the title bar of the window.

Press and release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key to bring up the *HUD*. The HUD is helpful for keyboard super users for searching though an application's menu.
