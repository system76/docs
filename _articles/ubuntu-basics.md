## Getting to Know the Ubuntu Desktop

Use the *Launcher* on the left hand side of the screen to start your favorite apps.  You can switch between running apps by clicking on their icons. Right click on an icon in the Launcher to show a menu of actions. Actions include adding, removing application icons, opening new tabs, switching multiple windows of the same app and much more.

When you click the Ubuntu Circle of Friends Logo at the top of your application list or the <kbd><span class="fl-ubuntu-inverse"></span></kbd> you'll open the *Dash.* Use the Dash to search or browse files, photos and applications.

Access the *Menu Bar* at the top of the screen to view options like *File, Edit, View* for the current application window you're working in. You can Mouse over the Menu Bar to see the drop-down menu.

*Window controls* are on the left of the title bar of the window.

When you press the left <kbd>Alt</kbd> key or right <kbd>Alt</kbd> key the *HUD* is brought up. The *HUD* is helpful for keyboard super users for searching though an application's menu.
