The Ubuntu operating system provides all the features you would expect from a sophisticated desktop.

### Getting to Know The Ubuntu Desktop

Use the Launcher on the left hand side of the screen to start your favorite apps. You can switch between running apps by clicking on their icons. Right click on an icon in the Launcher to show a menu of actions. Actions include adding, removing application icons, opening new tabs, switching multiple windows of the same app and much more.

Click the <span class="fl-ubuntu-inverse"> icon at the top of the launcher&mdash;or press the <kbd><span class="fl-ubuntu"></span></kbd> key on the keyboard&mdash;to open the Dash. Use the Dash to search or browse files, photos and applications.

Use the Menu Bar at the top of the screen to view options like **File**, **Edit**, and **View** for the current application window you're working in. You can Mouse over the Menu Bar to see the drop-down menu.

Window controls are on the left of the title bar of the window.

Press and release the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key to bring up the HUD. The HUD is helpful for keyboard super users for searching though an application's menu.
