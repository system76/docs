First, we recommend having Ubuntu installation media (a DVD or USB drive) handy before starting any upgrades in case something goes wrong. You'll need to download a copy of Ubuntu from [ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

### Create Install Media

Create an Installation USB | Create an Installation DVD
-------------------------- | ---------------------------
[Using Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu) | [Using Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-ubuntu)
[Using Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows) | [Using Windows](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-windows)
[Using Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx) | [Using Mac OS X](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx)

Next, we recommend backing up all important files from your computer. The upgrade process will leave your files intact, but it's best to be safe in case something goes wrong.

### Upgrade

Method |Reason
------ |:------:
[Upgrade While Running](#upgrade-while-running) | Great for moving to the next available release.
[Upgrade From Media](#upgrade-from-media) | Provides a more stable environment since the system isn't running while it's being upgraded. Upgrading from media is required if you're more than one version behind.

---

### Upgrade While Running

---

#### Open Software Updater

Open the Dash <i class="fl-ubuntu"></i> and then search for <u>Software Updater</u>.

![Updater in Dash](/images/upgrade-ubuntu/Step-1.jpg)

#### Configure Version Updates

Click on **Settings** and then select **Updates**. You can choose to receive all updates or only LTS updates using the drop-down menu at the bottom, labeled "Notify me of a new Ubuntu version".

Option | Result
------ | ------
For any new version | Will show both Standard and LTS updates.
For long-term support versions | Will show only LTS updates.
Never | Will prevent upgrades to newer versions.

![Update Preference](/images/upgrade-ubuntu/notification-preference.png)

Changing this option will require your user password. After selecting your update preference, close the window.

#### Check For Updates

The system will automatically check for updates. You may need to update (and sometimes, restart) before continuing with the upgrade process. If you have to restart after installing updates, launch the updater again as described above.

#### Install The Upgrade

A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release. Click **Upgrade** and follow the on-screen instructions.

#### Install The System76 Driver

Once you've upgraded Ubuntu, you'll need to download and install the current System76 Driver. Open the Terminal app (search <u>Terminal</u> from the Ubuntu dash <i class="fl-ubuntu"></i> or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), then enter the following commands:

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install system76-driver
```

For NVIDIA Graphics: If you ordered a system with a discrete NVIDIA graphics card, you will need to manually install the closed source drivers for your card to get the optimum performance. Please run the following command:

```
sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia
```

Once the process is finished, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

#### Done!

Once restarted the computer will be on the newly upgraded system! If you run into any issues, check out Troubleshooting below.

If you use any third-party packages, you'll need to re-enable them in the **Software & Updates** app on the **Other Software** tab. Check any sources that you might need, then close the window.

### Upgrade From Media

---

#### Start Installer

Insert the live disk, then restart the computer. You'll need to tell the computer to boot from the Live Disk. Immediately after you turn the computer on:

Laptops                             | Desktops
----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------
Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> | Hold <kbd>F12</kbd>, <kbd>F8</kbd>, or <kbd>F10</kbd>

#### Install Updates

When prompted, choose **Install Ubuntu**.

Next, check the box labeled **Download updates while installing Ubuntu** to bring your installation up to date.

![Download Updates](/images/install-ubuntu/updates.png)

#### Complete The Upgrade

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the upgrade. To preserve your files and settings, be sure to choose **Upgrade Ubuntu**. This will ensure that your files are not erased. You do have the option to erase your operating system and start over by choosing **Erase disk and install Ubuntu**. More information on this is available in our [Restore Guide](/articles/restore/).

If asked about installation of `grub_pc`, or other configuration packages, during the upgrade, you should select **Install the Package Maintainer's version**, not the default option.

#### Install The System76 Driver

Once you've upgraded Ubuntu, you'll need to download and install the current System76 Driver. Open the Terminal app (search <u>Terminal</u> from the Ubuntu dash <i class="fl-ubuntu"></i> or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), then enter the following commands:

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install system76-driver
```

For NVIDIA Graphics: If you ordered a system with a discrete NVIDIA graphics card, you will need to manually install the closed source drivers for your card to get the optimum performance. Please run the following command:

```
sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia
```

Once the process is finished, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

#### Done!

Once restarted the computer will be on the newly upgraded system! If you run into any issues, check out Troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting

Most upgrades proceed without issues, but occasionally things go wrong. If your system hangs on the upgrade process or if it reboots and won't start, then these steps can help repair your broken OS.

### Stuck Upgrades

If your upgrade appears to hang in place for an extended period of time, click on the **Terminal** item to expand the terminal section. Check what action is available there, then complete the steps to unhang your upgrade. For help, contact support and we'll be able to provide assistance.

### Broken Upgrade

Please see the steps above to create bootable media. Restart your computer and use the keys above to start your computer from the bootable media. When given the option, choose **Try Ubuntu**.

Next, follow the steps to repair grub first:

[Repair Bootloader](/articles/bootloader/)

And then the steps to repair the package manager next:

[Repair Package Manager](/articles/package-manager/)

And continue the upgrade with this command:

```
do-release-upgrade
```

After that, if all of the grub, apt package manager, and release upgrade commands successfully complete, the computer should be able to boot normally.
