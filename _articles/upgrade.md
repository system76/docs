# Upgrading to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS is the latest release of Ubuntu. It brings usability improvements and faster system performance resulting in a more responsive desktop experience. Major open source applications are also updated including LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, and more.

## 1. Prepare for the Upgrade

First, we recommend having Ubuntu installation media (i.e. a DVD or USB drive) handy before starting any upgrades in case something goes wrong. You'll need to download a copy of Ubuntu. You can download a copy from [ubuntu.com](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Save the file on your hard drive.

### Create an Installation USB Drive

Next, we recommend backing up all important files from your comptuer. The upgrade process will leave your files intact, but it's best to be safe in case something goes wrong.

## 2. Upgrade

There are a couple of options for actually upgrading Ubuntu to 16.04; you can either Upgrade Ubuntu in place, or install a fresh copy of Ubuntu.


### Upgrading in Place

#### 1. Launch the Software Updater

Press the Ubuntu Key on your keyboard to launch the Dash, then search for *updater*.

#### 2. Enable All Updates

Click on "Settings", then select the tab called *Updates*. Set the dropdown menu for *Notify me of a new Ubuntu Version* to "For any new version". Then close the window. If prompted, allow the package cache to be updated.

#### 3. Check for Updates

If there are any updates available, install them. When you're finished, click "Check for Updates" if available, then click on the "Upgrade..." button.

##### Stuck Upgrades

If your upgrade appears to hang in place for an extended period of time, click on the "Terminal" item to exand the terminal section. Check what action is available there, then complete the steps to unhang your upgrade. For help, contact us at support (see below) and we'll be able to provide assistance

### Installing a Fresh Copy of Ubuntu

#### 1. Start Up the Installer

Insert the live disk you made above, then restart your computer. You'll need to tell the computer to boot from the Live Disk. Immediately after you turn the computer on: 

Laptops                             | Desktops
----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------
Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> | Hold <kbd>F8</kbd> or <kbd>F10</kbd>

#### 2. Install Updates

During the initial setup, you may be asked to "Try Ubuntu" or to "Install Ubuntu". You'll need to choose the "Install Ubuntu" option to continue with the installation. Additionally, you will want to check the box labeled "Download updates while installing Ubuntu" to ensure that your new installation is fully up to date once the installation is complete.

###### Notes about Computers with Nvidia Graphics

Due to issues with the libllvm package (See [this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/oem-priority/+bug/1564156)) on the install disk, customers with 6th-Generation Core processors and Nvidia graphics will need to wait until 28th April, 2016 to be able to restore your computer. 

---


#### 4. Complete the Upgrade Process

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the upgrade. To preserve your files and settings, be sure to choose *Upgrade Ubuntu 15.10 to 16.04 LTS* (or *Upgrade Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to 16.04 LTS* if you're upgrading from 14.04). This will ensure that your files are not erased.

If asked about installation of `grub_pc` during the upgrade, you should select to **_Install the Package Maintainer's version_**, not the default option.

---

## 3. Install the System76 Driver

Once you've upgraded Ubuntu, you'll need to download and install the System76 Driver. Open the Terminal app (search _Terminal_ from the Ubuntu dash or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>), then enter the following commands:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:system76-dev/stable
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install system76-driver

---

**For NVIDIA Graphics:** If you ordered a system with a discrete Nvidia graphics card, you will need to manually install the drivers for your card to get the optimum performance. Open the Terminal app and enter the following command:

    sudo apt install system76-driver-nvidia

---

Once the process is finished, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
