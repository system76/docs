### Compatible systems

Machines with NVIDIA Cards are compatible with the following Docking Stations.

### Product and Model:

We have tested:
 - Plugable UD-3900 (http://plugable.com/products/ud-3900/)

### Pop!_OS

The recommended ISO to install Pop!_OS is the NVIDIA ISO as that will include the needed Drivers to run the cards. You'll also need the DisplayLink driver installed too (http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu)

To install the DisplayLink Driver
```
unzip DisplayLink\ USB\ Graphics\ Software\ for\ Ubuntu\ 1.4.zip
sudo ./displaylink-driver-1.4.210.run
```

### Ubuntu
