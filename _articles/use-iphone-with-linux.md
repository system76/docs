## [Backups (macOS)](#iphone-backups-macos)

Full system iPhone backups are traditionally done in one of two ways.
- Local backups (formerly iTunes, now Finder)

Local backups of an iPhone can be created by connecting it to an Apple laptop or desktop computer and using iTunes (for older macOS versions) or Finder (for newer releases) to create a local snapshot of iPhone data. These backups can be encrypted or unencrypted.

- iCloud backups

It is also possible to backup and sync iPhone changes to an iCloud account. These are not full-system backups, but do contain most of the data needed to restore and iPhone to a particular point in time.

## [Files/Photos (macOS)](#iphone-files-photos-macos)
An iPhone can be synced like a digital camera through the Apple Photos app, and a special directory on the iPhone called "Files" (presented on the iPhone as a home-screen app) is available to be accessed like any other flash drive or external hard drive.


## [Backups (Pop!\_OS)](#iphone-backups-popos)

- Local backups
Because the backup features in macOS Finder/iOS relies on proprietary code, Pop!\_OS does not have a built-in feature to make a local snapshot backup of an iPhone.

- iCloud backups.
Since iPhones connect directly to iCloud over WiFi, iCloud backups will continue as usual, and can be managed from either the iPhone or users' iCloud accounts on icloud.com.

## [Files/Photos (Pop!\_OS)](#iphone-files-photos-popos)
Like in macOS, users can also access image files, and files stored in the "Files" folder on the iPhone through the Pop!\_OS Files application. Files can be copied back and forth to the iPhone like any other flash drive or external drive.
