Mallee Blue Media is a web design, site management, and content marketing 
company with a focus on conversion optimization, founded by David Trounce and 
his wife in 2004. They help their clients be more efficient and effective in 
growing their own businesses. To lead by example, David needs the right 
equipment to get his work done.

> “People like me have limited time to play around. When I start a machine, I 
> just want to get to my work. As someone involved in marketing, my goal is to 
> remove obstacles for users. System76 does a solid, reliable job of taking 
> care of me as a user.”

The company started with an interest in e-commerce. Over time, it became clear 
that how they marketed their business was an opportunity in and of itself. 
Mallee Blue Media redirected their focus to offering these services to other 
small- and medium-sized businesses, growing alongside their customers over the 
last 15 years. 

Mallee Blue Media now houses half a dozen writers, two editors, and a few 
designers, and provides a combination of website and design services to their 
clients in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

> “We are a professional web design company providing quality site management 
> services to small business wanting to increase their reputation and brand 
> awareness online.”

The team offers content creation, HTML/CSS development, CMS integration, guest 
publishing, and more for businesses and digital marketing agencies. With all 
this going on, David had high expectations when he switched to running his web 
development company with Linux.

> “Linux had to prove itself to me first. Since I switched to Linux, I’ve 
> never had a crisis. I don’t worry about viruses, slow machines, software that 
> collapses on me. Instead, I have found the open source community to be 
> helpful and constructive.”

Today, David uses a variety of programs and plug-ins on Ubuntu, such as: 
SEORush, Colorzilla, Thunderbird, CrossOver by CodeWeavers, Skype, VLC, and 
LibreOffice, to help him craft long-term campaigns for his clients that they 
can later run themselves. For design, he uses a mix of Canva and GIMP, while 
OpenShot handles his video creation projects.

Linux has the professional-grade software and tools that David needs to get 
his work done, and System76 completes the picture with high-performance 
hardware. System76 ships the latest components vetted for quality, 
performance, and Linux compatibility.

> “If you want professional, business-ready machines, there are certain brands 
> that reflect that, like System76.”

When web developers need a reliable machine that comes with Linux 
pre-installed and dedicated Linux support, they choose System76. Connect with 
an expert today to learn more about System76’s Linux laptops, desktops, and
