Most of the hardware in a System76 computer is Intel based, and the Windows Update Program is rather effective at finding drivers.  We also recommend using Intel's Driver Update Program, which does an awesome job of finding drivers for Intel hardware:

For systems with NVIDIA graphics cards, NVIDIA drivers can be found on thier website:

Trackpad drivers for our laptops can be found on Synaptic's website:

Ethernet drivers can be found on Realtek's website:

If there are any missing drivers, open up the device manager, right click on the item with the missing driver, choose Properties, then Details, and look for the hardware PID of the device, and do an Internet search for that info.
