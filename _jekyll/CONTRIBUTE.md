## Additional Info

Here are links and external resources.  Other relevant info can be put here.

# **Style**

Anything actionable.  Anything clicked on:  
**Buttons or Menu Options or Radial Buttons or Checkboxes or Tabs or Options to pick**

Any programs or applications or software:  
<u>Programs or Applications or Things to Run</u>

*Things Typed into boxes*

'Window or Dialog Titles'

"Things referenced on a window or log"

Talking about a command should go on its own line:

```
Singular commands
```

And then text can continue.  Wrap all commands in full length blocks.  For lots of commands in a row, use a block:

```
Lots of commands
Here
Run this
```

<small>\*This is a small note</small>

Keyboard keys:  
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd>

If you are talking about terminal items such as `/dev/sda` or `[sudo] password for james:` or `Bus 002 Device 002: ID 8087:8000 Intel Corp.` should go in a code block.

File locations such as `/usre/share/xsessions` or files such as `meer1-bios.zip` are also wrapped in a code block.
