Pop!_OS shares many accessibility options with Gnome. These features expand Pop!_OS's usability to more users. If there are additional tools or options that you would like to see added to Pop!_OS in the future please let us know and we will see if implementation is possible.

Additional information can be found on GNOME accessibility web page [here](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/a11y.html).

## Screen Readers

For visual impairments [Orca](https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable/introduction.html.en) is a screen reading tool for low sighted and blind users.

*Orca is a free, open source, flexible, and extensible screen reader that provides access to the graphical desktop via speech and refreshable braille.*

In Pop!_OS using the GNOME desktop environment, Orca can be launched automatically via the Universal Access Control Center under the Seeing section.

• To toggle Orca on and off press Super + Alt +S
*Once engaged you will hear a voice confirmation “screen reader on” and it will begin reading the text on the screen through your speakers.*

• You can also type ‘orca’ along with optional parameters in the terminal and press Return.

Orca can also be enabled during installation by using the Super + Alt + S keys.
