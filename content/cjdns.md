# Install cjdns

## Install Dependencies

```bash 
sudo apt-get install nodejs git build-essential python2.7
```  

Next, clone the repo and build!

```bash
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns.git
cd cjdns
./do
```

Now, check `bash ./cjdroute`  
Make sure you got the swag.  

```bash
LANG=C cat /dev/net/tun
```

If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: File descriptor in bad state` Good!  
If it says: `cat: /dev/net/tun: No such file or directory`, create it using:  

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /dev/net &&
sudo mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200 &&
sudo chmod 0666 /dev/net/tun
```

After a little wait, the build should finish successfully. Now we want to configure cjdns to run as a daemon, so letâ€™s create a link to the binary, generate a configuration file, and copy over the service file.

```bash
ln -s /opt/cjdns/cjdroute /usr/bin
(umask 077 && ./cjdroute --genconf > /etc/cjdroute.conf)
cp contrib/systemd/cjdns.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

Now that we have that, we can configure it in nano /etc/cjdroute.conf and enable it for automatic start on boot.

```bash
systemctl enable cjdns
systemctl start cjdns
```

You will connect automatically with WiFi, but you can peer over the Internet too!  See more at the Whitepaper and the README!
