If you are having trouble logging into your account or opening a support ticket, a good first troubleshooting step is to clear your browser's cache and cookies.

To clear your cookies and web cache, navigate to the Settings menu in your web browser. 

If you are using Firefox or Chrome, you can find settings by looking at the right corner of the navigation bar and clicking the 3 stacked lines (Firefox) or dots (Chrome). 

The cache and cookies are located in the Privacy and Security settings and will have an option to delete or clear the stored data. 

We've included screen captures for both Firefox and Chrome here:
