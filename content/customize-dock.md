Pop!\_OS and Ubuntu both contain an application dock on the left side of the screen. You can adjust this preference, move the dock to the bottom of the screen, and more in <u>Settings</u>.

## Default Dock on Pop!\_OS

Pop!\_OS includes a lightweight version of Dash to Dock, which is why the dock already displays on the bottom of the screen by default.

If you need more options or want to make more changes to the dock you can install Dash to Dock using the steps below.

## Dash to Dock on Ubuntu

When using Dash to Dock on Ubuntu it can effect the default Dock as it was forked from that project. When you enable the full version of Dash to Dock, it will override the built-in version.

To install Dash to Dock on Ubuntu, you will first need to install the "native host connector," which allows Firefox to install and remove GNOME Shell extensions and the GNOME Shell <u>Extension</u> application. This component is installed by default in Pop!\_OS, but it is not installed by default in Ubuntu. Open a terminal and run this command to install the native host connector:

```bash
sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell gnome-shell-extensions
```

Enter your password and press "y" to confirm if necessary.
