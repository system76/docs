Pop!\_OS and Ubuntu both contain an application dock on the screen. The location of the dock, as well as other dock settings, can be adjusted in <u>Settings</u>.

## Default Dock on Pop!\_OS

Pop!\_OS's dock is positioned along the bottom edge of the screen by default.

## dconf Editor

Since both Ubuntu Dock and COSMIC Dock are based on Dash to Dock they have the same settings which can be changed using <u>dconf editor</u>. This can be installed either though the <u>Pop!\_Shop</u> (if you are on Pop!\_OS), <u>Ubuntu Software</u> (if you are on Ubuntu) or with this command on either OS:

```bash
sudo apt install dconf-editor
```
