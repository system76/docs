Every day, hundreds of faculty, staff, and students at The Colorado Center for 
Astrodynamics Research (CCAR) rely on powerful machines for projects such as 
atmospheric research and asteroid missions. Steve Hart, IT Professional for 
CCAR at the University of Colorado Boulder, shares why he trusts System76 
computers to save him hours when connecting machine learning researchers with 
reliable hardware.

> “I provide complete on-site IT support for all Faculty within CCAR, 
> including Desktop support, Server support, data storage, and any other IT 
> services,” Steve explains as he introduces himself. 

> “This includes hardware purchasing and configuration to fit the specific 
> research needs of the user in question.” 

Supporting such a breadth of work means relying on a mix of technologies and 
providers to find the best fit for each project. He previously built his own 
systems (and still does as-needed), but an option for relief came when he 
found System76, a Linux computer company. 

> “I first started purchasing System76 desktops as the hardware specs matched 
> what I choose for a custom build and the overall price was comparable. It 
> saved me time in choosing individual parts and system assembly. I was able 
> to deploy systems quicker to my users.”

Speed is key as he supports prolific researchers operating under strict 
grant requirements. Earlier this year after winning a major grant, a 
researcher at CCAR’s Space Weather Center came to Steve needing equipment 
for heavy computational workloads, including machine learning.

They considered cost, performance, procurement guidelines, and regulatory 
compliance and decided on a high-performance desktop from System76. The deep 
learning work utilized the powerful TensorFlow software library on Linux to 
analyze atmospheric weather patterns. 

> “Working with pre-installed Linux helps in that it takes me less time 
> hand-picking hardware that may or may not be fully compatible with the latest 
> Linux kernels,” Steve notes.

These efficiencies save hours of time compared to the hardware selection and 
build time required when building the computers himself, and avoids the 
potential for additional delays waiting on individual parts. When the 
pre-installed Linux equipment arrives, it is ready for deployment out of the 
box.

System76 combines ease of using Linux with high-end performance for heavy 
computational workloads, including laptops, desktops, and servers.

> “Desktops are vital. They are the workhorse for numerical analysis. Many 
> users have tried to move their processing needs to laptops but more often 
> than not, they always fall back on the desktops and servers for their speed 
> and ability to process complex code/datasets.” 

System76 has users at 97% of the Tier 1 Research Universities in the United 
States with hardware, software, and service that meet rigorous research 
standards. System76 might be a good fit for you too. Connect with an expert
