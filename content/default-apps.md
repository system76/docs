Pop!\_OS: Productive out of the box. Easy to modify to meet individual needs

## Principles for default app inclusion

1. Include apps that create a cohesive desktop experience

   * A link opens a browser
   * An event invite adds it to the Calendar
   * Defining a word opens Dictionary
   * An address opens Maps

2. Leverage online accounts

   * Surface users online data in local applications

3. Prefer GNOME Core apps and apps that follow the GNOME HIG

4. Include apps that open common formats

5. Include utilities that enable accessing and manipulating external media

   * Make external media immediately useful

6. When there is no clear app for a universal need, surface options in the app store

7. Do not duplicate functionality

8. Be constantly cognisant of memory use
