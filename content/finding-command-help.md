Even experienced Linux users frequently utilize knowledge resources to find proper syntax for Terminal commands, or to discover options for known commands. All Linux shells support common utilities that search for and explain commands for a given task. These commands may navigate the user to a text file or navigable structure of help files, while others simply print output into the current Terminal session.

### Why Find Help Using the Terminal?

Issues may disable user access to the desktop environment, including the web browser. In these scenarios, users can still find help that displays as output in a Terminal session. Users who still have access to a browser or second computer can find help using the [Ubuntu](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/) or [Debian](https://manpages.debian.org/) manpage websites. The commands below are entered in a Terminal session. In Pop!\_OS, Terminal sessions can be started by pressing <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>.

### --help

`--help` prints out a shortened version of the man page, usually including a brief example and all options for a command. `--help` prints output to the terminal session without navigating away from the shell prompt.

**Use case**: A user wants to quickly reference all options for a known command in the current Terminal session.

**Usage**: Type a command + `--help`, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This example uses the `cd` command. Commands must be an exact match.

```bash
cd --help
```

### whatis

`whatis` provides a very short description of a command's functionality.

**Use case**: A user wants a very brief reminder of a known command's functionality printed in the current Terminal session.

**Usage**: Type `whatis` + command, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This example uses the `mkdir` command. Commands must be an exact match.

```bash
whatis mkdir
```

### dpkg -S

`dpkg -S` provides an index of files installed from a package.

**Use case**: A user is attempting to learn about commands included with a recently installed package.

**Usage**: Type `dpkg -S` + package name, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This command only works with currently-installed packages.

```bash
dpkg -S pop-upgrade
```

### which & dpkg -S

`which` provides the file location of a command. The output of `which` can be passed into `dpkg -S` to perform a search of associated packages.

**Use case**: A user would like to know which installed package provides a specific command.

**Usage**: Type `which` + command, then pipe the output of `which` into `dpkg -S` using `xargs`. The `xargs` command allows users to pass the output of a command as standard input into another command. The below example searches for the path of the `libreoffice` command, and then searches for the package associated with that path.

```bash
which libreoffice | xargs dpkg -S
```

#### Commands within symlinked directories

Users may see an error stating no matching path can be found:

```bash
which mkdir | xargs dpkg -S
```

![dpkg -S output with no results](/images/finding-command-help/dpkg-search-no-results.png)

This occurs when a package is programmed to install a file to one directory, but that directory is symlinked to another directory on the system; in this situation, the package manager installs the file to a directory that differs from the original package's progamming. The following directories are commonly symlinked on Pop!_OS systems:

| Symlink Name | Actual Directory |
|--------------|------------------|
| /bin         | /usr/bin         |
| /sbin        | /usr/sbin        |
| /lib         | /usr/lib         |
| /lib64       | /usr/lib64       |

If `dpkg -S` is unable to find a match, run `which` manually, remove `/usr` from the beginning of the output, and reattempt the command:

```bash
which mkdir
dpkg -S /bin/mkdir
```

![dpkg file lookup with a /usr symlink](/images/finding-command-help/dpkg-search-usr-symlink.png)

In the above example, the `mkdir` command (which comes from the `coreutils` package) was supposed to be installed to `/bin/mkdir`, but is located at `/usr/bin/mkdir` instead because `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin` in Pop!_OS.

#### Commands symlinked to other files

Sometimes, a command may not be an executable itself, but may be symlinked to an executable installed by a different package. To check if this is the case, after getting the command's path with `which`, run the path through `ls -l` to display any link information:

```bash
which reboot
ls -l /usr/sbin/reboot
dpkg -S /bin/systemctl
```

![dpkg file lookup with a symlinked executable](/images/finding-command-help/dpkg-search-symlinked-executable.png)

In the above example, the `reboot` command is located at `/usr/sbin/reboot` (which is installed from the `systemd-sysv` package), but that file is actually a symlink to `/bin/systemctl` (which comes from the `systemd` package.)

### apropos

`apropos` performs a keyword search on command man pages. This is useful when searching for a command by its function. `apropos` prints output to the terminal session without navigating away from the shell prompt.

**Use case**: A user can't remember the specific name of a command, but knows keywords commonly used to describe the command's functions.

**Usage**: Type `apropos` + keyword, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This example searches for commands related to the `reboot` keyword.

```bash
apropos reboot
```

### man

`man` is short for manual pages. A command's manual page is a consistently structured text file describing the command's function, usage syntax, options, and similar commands. `man` opens a manpage in the terminal session, and pressing <kbd>q</kbd> exits the manpage and returns the user to the shell prompt.

**Use case**: A user wants to see actions performed by a specific command, and available options to modify the outcome of the command.

**Usage**: Type `man` + any command into a Terminal session, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This example uses the `reboot` command.

```bash
man reboot
```

### info

`info` pages are similar to man pages; however, their descriptions for command usage are more in-depth and include examples of output. Users can also navigate to other related info pages using hypertext links within the info page. `info` opens an info page in the Terminal session, and pressing <kbd>q</kbd> exits the manpage and returns the user to the shell prompt.

|Key | Function |
|-------|------|
|<kbd>Arrow Up</kbd>| Move up one line|
|<kbd>Arrow Down</kbd>| Move down one line|
|<kbd>Tab</kbd>|Move to next hyperlink|
|<kbd>Enter</kbd>| Select a hyperlink|
|<kbd>Page Up</kbd>| Move up one page|
|<kbd>Page Down</kbd> or <kbd>Space bar</kbd>| Move down one page|
|<kbd>n</kbd>| Move to next info page|
|<kbd>p</kbd>| Move to previous info page|
|<kbd>q</kbd>| Exit the info page|

**Use case**: A user wants to see examples of command usage, command output, and easily navigate to commands offering related or supporting functionality.

**Usage**: Type `info` + any command into a Terminal session, then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. This example uses the `ls` command.

```bash
info ls
```
