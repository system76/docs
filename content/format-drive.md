## Live Disk or Pop Recovery

In order to format the drive that has your OS on it we will need to boot from either a live disk or the Pop Recovery partition.

### Option 1: Live USB

A live disk is a bootable USB storage device that runs the entire operating system in RAM. See [this article for instructions to create a bootable Pop!\_OS live USB.](/articles/live-disk/)

### Option 2: Pop Recovery Partition

The Recovery Partition is a full copy of the Pop!_OS installation disk. It can be used exactly the same as if a live disk copy of Pop!_OS was booted from a USB drive. The existing operating system can be repaired or reinstalled from the recovery mode. See [this article for instructions to boot into the Pop!\_OS recovery partition.](/articles/pop-recovery/)

### Disks application

The <u>Disks</u> application can be used to format the drive to remove any personal data. Disks comes pre-installed on Pop!\_OS and Ubuntu.

In this screenshot the drive is a USB Flash Drive, though the concept is the same for any drive, including the drive where your OS is installed. First left-click on the drive on the left side then left-click on the top right menu with three dots (three lines on older releases).

Now select the `Format Disk...` option then make sure to have the 'Compatible with modern systems and hard drives > 2TB (GPT)' selected (you can use either the Quick option or the Slow option).
