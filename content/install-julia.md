Julia is a high-level programming language popularly used for numerical analysis and computational science. More information can be found [on Julia's site](https://julialang.org/). While many Linux distributions lack documentation or require installing Julia from source, Pop!\_OS offers simple install methods using the Terminal or the Pop!\_Shop. Pop!\_OS will also track the latest Julia releases, so Julia will always update to the latest available release when you update Pop!\_OS.
