This BIOS update enables VT-x for virtualization on your Lemur.  These instructions only apply to the Lemur 7. They do not apply to any other model of computer we sell.

This will update your BIOS to version 1.05.14RSA4/EC 1.05.02SA3.

### Prerequisites

1. If you have a BIOS password set, clear this prior to updating. This can be done by holding down <kbd>F2</kbd> when you computer starts, and going to the <u>Security</u> tab.  Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the Supervisor/Boot passwords, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when prompted for a new password.  This password is not the same as the user account password in the operating system.  This is the hardware level, BIOS password, that needs cleared.

2. Remove all external USB drives and devices.

3. Ensure your computer is set to boot with UEFI mode enabled in the Boot menu.  If the computer has not been changed to Legacy boot mode in the BIOS, then UEFI boot is the default setting.  UEFI boot mode does not show a System76 logo when the computer first starts, while BIOS mode does.

### Updating BIOS

1. Format a USB drive with MBR (msdos) FAT32 formating.  To format a USB drive, use the built-in program <u>Disks</u> or the installable program <u>Gparted</u>.  Do not use <u>UNetbootin</u> as it adds additional files that are not needed.  Make sure the USB drive is clean before extracting the archive to the drive.

2. Download the [lemu7.zip](/files/firmware/lemu7-bios.zip) file, double click the file to open it, click **Extract**, and choose the USB drive as the destination. 

3. Connect AC power to the laptop. AC power is required to update.

4. Restart your Lemur and hold <kbd>F7</kbd> during boot.  Choose the USB drive from the boot menu.  It will be labeled as the brand of USB drive, such as Sandisk or Cuzer.

5. At the prompt, type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (this switches to the USB drive to run the updates).

6. Type in `meset` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This unlocks the ME for flashing.  The computer will turn off and reboot.  The fans will be at 100% for the next steps.  If they are not, please plug in AC power and try again.

7. Hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

8. Type in `flashme` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will flash the ME, and then the BIOS.  The computer will then turn off.

9. Power the computer on and hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

10. Type in `ecflash` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will flash the EC.  The computer will then turn off.

11. Power the computer on and hold <kbd>F7</kbd> to boot from USB again.  Type in `fs1:` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

12. Type in `eol` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  This will lock the ME and turn the computer off.

Enjoy using your Lemur with the fancy new BIOS!
