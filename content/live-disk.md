## Overview

Pop!_OS and Ubuntu are remarkably flexible. You can run a full version of Pop!_OS or Ubuntu from a USB drive (often known as a thumb drive, flash drive, or USB stick) in what's known as a *live environment*. Using a live environment (live disk) is useful for:

- [Installing Pop!_OS](/articles/install-pop/)
- [Installing Ubuntu](/articles/install-ubuntu/)
- Recovering your existing operating system
- Backing up files when you can't boot
- [Determining if an issue is caused by hardware or software](/articles/hardware-failure/)
- [Fixing the boot loader](/articles/bootloader)

A live disk is a handy tool to have around. Support recommends using a live disk when doing hardware troubleshooting.

## Downloading the ISO

In order to install Pop!_OS or Ubuntu, you must first download the .iso image. This is a disk image with the operating system and installer on it. You can [download Pop!_OS here](https://pop.system76.com) or [Ubuntu 20.04 here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

## Verifying the Download

Verifying your download is an important step: we generate a "checksum" for Pop!_OS images and recommend that you verify that your download matches that checksum before trying to install. This ensures that you've received the full, complete download and that it is not corrupted.

### For Ubuntu/Pop!_OS

Assuming you downloaded Pop!_OS to your ~/Downloads folder, open the Terminal (<kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'pop-os']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> on Pop!_OS or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> on Ubuntu) and run the following command:

#### For Intel/AMD iso

```
sha256sum Downloads/pop-os_21.10_amd64_intel_7.iso
```

#### For NVIDIA iso

```
sha256sum Downloads/pop-os_21.10_amd64_nvidia_7.iso
```

**Note:** The .iso filenames will change over time, so please make sure you are using the correct .iso filename.

If the checksum does not match the one on the [download page](https://pop.system76.com), you may need to re-download your copy of Pop!_OS and ensure it completes downloading before re-verifying it.

### For Windows

Assuming you downloaded Pop!_OS to your Downloads folder, open the Command Prompt and run the following command:

#### For Intel/AMD iso

```
CertUtil -hashfile Downloads\pop-os_21.10_amd64_intel_7.iso sha256
```

#### For NVIDIA iso

```
CertUtil -hashfile Downloads\pop-os_21.10_amd64_nvidia_7.iso sha256
```

**Note:** The .iso filenames will change over time, so please make sure you are using the correct .iso filename.

If the checksum does not match the one on the [download page](https://pop.system76.com), you may need to re-download your copy of Pop!_OS and ensure it completes downloading before re-verifying it.

## Making the Bootable Drive

In order to make the bootable live disk, you must have a flash drive and software to write the Pop!_OS .iso image to the drive. There's a variety of applications you can use to write disk images to a flash drive, but for this tutorial, we'll use the Popsicle utility for Linux and Etcher for macOS/Windows.

If you are comfortable with using Flatpak, Popsicle is available in Flathub [here](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.system76.Popsicle)! If you want to setup Flatpak on your system, you can visit [this](https://flatpak.org/setup/) link. Popsicle is included in all recent Pop_OS! releases by default (18.04)+.

If you'd just like to quickly launch Popsicle by downloading a file, there is an AppImage available from AppImageHub, downloadable [here](https://appimage.github.io/Popsicle/). AppImages run on most Linux variants and don't require installation or terminal commands.

### For Linux

If you're on Pop or Ubuntu:

Press the <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'pop-os']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd>/<kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'ubuntu']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd> key then type 'Popsicle' to launch the Popsicle application.

If you're on a different distribution, either locate the AppImage by right-clicking on it within your Downloads folder, selecting "Properties" and click the option to make the image executable. If it is the Flatpak, simply search "Popsicle" using your distro's application launcher and it should appear.

Pick *Choose Image* and navigate to where you downloaded Pop!_OS, click on it and hit the *open* button:

![Select Pop!_OS iso](/images/pop-live-disk/popsicle-image-selection.png)

Next, select the drive that you want to use; the name of the drive most likely will be the brand name, e.g. "SanDisk" or "Kingston".

![Popsicle Flash Drive Selected](/images/pop-live-disk/popsicle-drive-selection.png)

Now hit the *Flash* button and watch the magic happen!

![Flashing Pop!_OS...](/images/pop-live-disk/popsicle-progress.png)

![Flash Complete](/images/pop-live-disk/popsicle-finished.png)

Once the flash is complete (should look like the screenshot above), it's time to boot it up on the machine that you want to install Pop!_OS on!

### For Windows/macOS

Etcher is an open source app for Windows, macOS, and Linux that allows you to burn disk images to USB drives. You can download it at [balena.io/etcher/](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).

Once you have installed Etcher and downloaded the Pop!_OS.iso image, open up the Etcher application. You should see something like this:

![Etcher Startup](/images/live-disk-new/etcher01-start.png)

Choose `Flash from file` and then navigate to where you downloaded the Pop!_OS ISO file (typically your "Downloads" folder). Click on the file then and hit the `Open` button. On Windows, it should look something like this:

![Select Pop!_OS iso](/images/live-disk-new/etcher02-filepicker.png)

Now click on `Select Target`:

![Click on Select Target](images/live-disk-new/etcher03-select-target.png)

Next, select the drive that you want to use by checking the box next to it. It should only show removable drives by default. After the box for your USB stick is checked, click on the `Select` button:

![Flash Drive Select](/images/live-disk-new/etcher04-select-device.png)

Now hit the `Flash` button and it will start writing to the USB drive.

![Click Finish](/images/live-disk-new/etcher05-select-finish.png)

Now you'll see a progress bar, and some information about other projects by _balena_, the company that makes Etcher. Wait for it to finish writing to the USB device.

![Flashing the drive](/images/live-disk-new/etcher06-in-progress.png)

When it's complete, you can just close the app.

Now it's time to boot it up on the machine that you want to install Pop!_OS on!

## Booting From the Live Disk

After creating the live disk, insert the USB drive into your computer, then reboot or power on your system. You'll need to tell the computer to boot from the live disk by holding a key right as you power on:

 Firmware             | Laptops                                                               | Desktops                                              |
 -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
 Proprietary Firmware | Hold <kbd>F7</kbd>/<kbd>F1</kbd>/<kbd>F2</kbd> | Hold <kbd>F12</kbd>, <kbd>F8</kbd>, or <kbd>F10</kbd>                        |
 [Open Firmware](https://support.system76.com/articles/open-firmware-systems)        | Hold <kbd>Esc</kbd>                                            |

If done correctly, you should see a boot device selection menu, like one of the following images.

This menu is on our Closed Firmware systems.

![Boot Menu](/images/live-disk/boot-menu.jpg)

This menu is on our Open Firmware systems.

![One Time Boot](/images/boot-menu/one-time-boot.jpg)

Use the arrow keys to select the USB drive, then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to boot the selection.

Pop!_OS will boot into the familiar Pop!_OS desktop.

## Using the Live Environment

The list provided at the beginning of the article provides links to other articles on using the live environment for hardware testing, restoration/upgrades, and boot repair.

### Repairing an Existing Operating System

Since the live environment is a full Pop!_OS installation, it works just like the normal environment. There are tools and methods that allow to `chroot` (change root) into the normal installation and work in the existing operating system to repair a broken package or other problem that is preventing normal booting.

### Backing Up Files

Perhaps you're reinstalling, or maybe you can't boot but you want to try and recover and back up your files? The live environment will automatically detect and mount most file systems including Linux and Windows. You can then copy files from the disk to another external disk using the familiar <u>Files</u> utility.
