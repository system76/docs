Log files help our support team learn more about your system, and can be a great benefit during troubleshooting.

The information collected by the log files includes:

* The installed operating system and active kernel version
* A listing of the filesystems connected to your system, and the space used
* Information about your firmware
* A list of disks connected to your system, as well as connected USB devices
* Sensors information showing temperatures and fan speeds
* Comprehensive output from `syslog` and `journalctl`

The detailed contents of the log file are listed below:

```
/apt/sources.list.d/*
/apt/history.log
/apt/history-rotated.log
/apt/sources.list
/apt/term.log
/apt/term-rotated.log
df
dmesg
dmidecode
fstab
journalctl
lsblk
lspci
lsusb
sensors
syslog.log
systeminfo.txt
upower
uptime
xorg.0.log
```

## Generating Log Files in Settings (Pop!_OS 21.10+)

Starting in Pop!\_OS 21.10, logs are no longer generated through the <u>System76 Driver</u> application. Instead, a "Support" section has been added to the <u>Settings</u> application. Clicking the `Create Log Files` button will prompt you for your admin password, and then generate and save a file called `pop-support_[timestamp].tar.xz`. This file is saved in your Home directory (`/home/username`).

## Generating Log Files Using the System76 Driver Application

The System76 Driver can be opened by clicking the `Activities` or `Applications` button in the top left (or pressing the <kbd>SUPER</kbd> key), then searching for "System76." Among the applications listed should be the <u>System76 Driver</u> application. Click the icon to launch the application, and enter your password when prompted to do so.

Next click on the button outlined in red in the <u>System76 Driver</u> application and a file called `system76-logs.tgz` will be created and placed in your Home directory (`/home/username`).

### Manually Generating Log Files

If for some reason you are unable to access the <u>System76 Driver</u> application, you can manually create a set of log files by running a series of commands via the <u>Terminal</u> application. To do this, click `Activities`/`Applications` in the top left of your system, search for "Terminal", then open the application that appears.

You can also launch <u>Terminal</u> with keyboard shortcuts:

Pop - <kbd>SUPER</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>

Ubuntu - <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>

From there, you can enter the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/
mkdir ~/system76
journalctl > ~/system76/journal.log
dmesg > ~/system76/dmesg.log
cp ~/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log ~/system76/Xorg.0.log 2> /dev/null
sudo dmidecode > ~/system76/demidecode
sudo lspci -vv > ~/system76/lspci.log
sudo lsusb -vv > ~/system76/lsusb.log
uname -a > ~/system76/uname.log
cp /etc/os-release ~/system76/os-release
lsblk -f > ~/system76/lsblk.log
df -h > ~/system76/df.log
cp /etc/fstab ~/system76/fstab.log
tar czf system76-log.tgz ~/system76/*
rm ~/system76/*
rmdir ~/system76
```

As with the <u>System76 Driver</u> application, the log files will be stored within your home directory.

### Sending the Logs to the Support Team

Once the logs are created, you can attach them directly to the support case.

> **NOTE:** In some cases, error messages can grow log files to a size too large for an email attachment. If that's the case, use a file sharing service like Google Drive or [Wormhole](https://wormhole.app/), and then include the share link in an email response to the support ticket.
