Did you get sick of Minecraft? Microsoft controlling it and ripping apart our beloved game? Well fear no more! Luanti is similar to Minecraft, but it is a truly infinite voxel game engine, written in C++ for speed and easy cross-compatiblity with different platforms, all licensed under the LGPL. With powerful modding features, there are many custom games, mods, and texture packs available from its community!

## Installation

To install on Ubuntu/Pop\_OS!, first add the PPA to the system's software sources.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:minetestdevs/stable
```

The Luanti package (named `minetest`) is now available to install.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install minetest
```

Now you can play the game!

## Adding Games, Mods, and Texture Packs

When you open Luanti, you'll be prompted to install a game from [ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/), the home of hundreds of different custom games, mods, and texture packs!

Start with [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Luanti/minetest_game/), the official base game. Explore the mods and texture packs created for it!

## Connecting to Servers

To connect to a server, choose one from the list, then choose a username and password on the right side of the screen. The server will then connect. The next time you use the server, simply put in the same username and password! Custom mods are automatically loaded, so no fuss is needed.
