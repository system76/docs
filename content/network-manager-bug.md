There is a bug in the program that manages networking, <u>network-manager</u>, which prevents wireless networks from being shown the first time the computer is used. This issue is present even if a WiFi access point was joined during the new user setup.

To join an access point, the computer can be restarted, or this command can be run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
```

There is a bug report filed here:

[Bug 1576024](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1576024)

Any additional people that mark <span style="color: #093;">Does this bug affect you?</span> on that bug report will help gain additional traction from developers to get this issue resolved.
