Hello!

You have landed on a placeholder page because our website has had some changes as of Novemember 5th, 2024. Links in support emails that land here are no longer supported by the new site.

We want to help you if you have questions, concerns, or ongoing issues! If you are logged into your System76.com account, the following link will allow you to create a support ticket now: [Open New Support Ticket](https://system76.com/contact/support)

## Suggested Self-help Steps

### 1. Do you have a current backup of your files?

If your issue is time-sensitive, reinstalling or [refreshing](/articles/pop-recovery#refresh-install) the operating system may provide the fastest resolution. Be sure to back up all important data before performing any tests or contacting Support. Re-imaging is much easier to do if we know that your important files are safe.

**Note**: This guide may cover diagnostics and testing that you've already performed. Skip those sections as needed, but be sure to provide that information when submitting your ticket.

For guidance backing up your system, see [Back Up Files](/articles/backup-files).

### 2. Do you have a Pop!\_OS or Ubuntu Live USB?

A Live USB can be used as a rescue disk. This will provide you with an outside OS environment to access your installed system, potentially rescue files that have not been backed up, or quickly reinstall the OS if necessary.

We have an article to guide you through [creating Live USBs](/articles/live-disk).

The default Pop!\_OS install also has a recovery partition that provides the same purpose as a Live USB drive. Accessing the recovery partition is covered in the [Recovery Partition](/articles/pop-recovery) article.

## Local Repair and Upgrades

We offer techincal documentation such as service manuals in the [Find Documentation For Your Model](/articles/guides) article.

## Common Issue Sources

### Software

See [Software Troubleshooting Triage](/articles/software-triage) for assistance troubleshooting software issues.

### Environment

1. Are any other machines or users in your home or workspace experiencing the same issue?
2. If the issue involves networking, have you tried resetting your modem/router?

   **NOTE:** Networking errors can be device-specific -- doing a full power cycle is strongly suggested before making changes at the OS level.

3. Are there any devices in proximity with your system that could be causing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interference?
4. Is your work environment a stable temperature or has it been particularly warm or cold lately?
5. Have you added any external devices or accessories to your machine and workflow lately?
6. Has the machine ever suffered any fall or liquid damage?

### Hardware

Changes to networking or other performance on your computer can be signs of hardware failure. We also recommend following this guide for [diagnosing hardware failure](/articles/hardware-failure).

## What Information Should I Provide to Support?

Any information or test results you can provide when opening your support case will help us resolve your issue faster. Please answer as many questions as you can, using this article as a guide for gathering information to submit when opening a support case.

## Attaching Files In Your Ticket

The summary that you send to start a ticket does not support file attachments; however, you can reply to the initial automated message with any attachements that you feel will be helpful.

If you're having difficulty attaching a file, you can also email the file to info@system76.com. Please be sure to tell us on the ticket if you have sent an email attachment.

## Repair & Replacement

We have several repair or replacement options available depending on the circumstances.

We build and ship a replacement system with the same configuration, and have you return the defective system once the new one is received. More details will be provided if this process is required.

### Advance Replacement Part - Within Warranty Period

We send a replacement part for self-service or service at a local repair shop, then have you return the defective part. We also provide the service manual for your machine if applicable.

More details will be provided if this process is requested.
