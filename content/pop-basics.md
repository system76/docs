Welcome to the Pop!_OS desktop! By default, it's clean and ready for action.
The Pop!_OS operating system provides all the features you would expect from a modern desktop.

Pop!\_OS is based on Ubuntu, however, extra features and tools have been added, while other aspects have been slimmed down. You can read more about Pop!\_OS features and the differences between Pop!\_OS and Ubuntu [here](/articles/difference-between-pop-ubuntu).

## Pop!_OS Desktop Environment

The Pop!_OS Desktop environment is based on GNOME shell and layered with other components called **Pop!\_Shell** and **C.O.S.M.I.C. (Computer Operating System Main Interface Components)** For more info, including source code, refer to [this page](https://github.com/pop-os/).

Once familiar with the Pop!\_OS default settings, users may want to further [customize](/articles/customize-gnome) the desktop environment (DE), or even [install another DE](/articles/desktop-environment) alongside the default.

## Workflow

Pop!\_OS is designed to provide smooth, efficient workflow features. There are several options for control and navigation.

### COSMIC Workflow

This video shows how to use the `Launcher`, and how to switch between open applications. Applications and tiling functions can be controlled with keyboard shortcuts or trackpad gestures. It also covers customizing the dock size, behavior and position.

To open the `Launcher` press the <kbd>SUPER</kbd> key. or click the launcher icon in the Dock.

To switch between open applications you can click, or arrow down, the list of applications in the Launcher window, or swipe with three fingers in the direction of the application window.

Swipe with four fingers to the left to open `Workspaces`. Swipe with four fingers to the right to open `Applications`.

To customize the Dock, as well as other aspects of the look and feel of the Pop!\_OS desktop environment, navigate to `Settings` -> `Desktop`. To change settings for the Dock select the `Dock` submenu.

`Dock` settings include, for example:

- `Extend dock to the edges of the screen` or only take up space in the middle.
- Be located on the `Bottom of the screen`, `Along the left side` or `Along the right side` of the screen.
- `Always visible` or `Intelligently hide` when app windows share the same space.
- Dock and Icon size adjustments.

### Stacking Tutorial

<iframe width="900" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TSdFWY_U9A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This video covers how to use Pop!\_OS' tile-stacking feature to take advantage of Pop!\_Shell window organization on smaller displays.

- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> converts a window to a stack. Dragging a window out of the stack and repeating the <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> combination again converts back to a standard window.

- <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd> then use the arrow keys <kbd>←</kbd> , <kbd>→</kbd> , <kbd>↑</kbd> , <kbd>↓</kbd> (or Vim shortcuts) to move windows into or out of the stack. You can also click and drag windows into the stack.

**NOTE:** In 20.04, the `Launcher` keyboard shortcut is <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>, and pressing <kbd>SUPER</kbd> opens the `Activities` overview.

- While on an active stack, launching an application from the `Launcher` or the `Activities` overview will automatically add it to the stack.

- You can switch between windows in the stack by pressing <kbd>SUPER</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd>.

### Auto Tiling Tutorial

## Desktop Menus and Navigation

### Pop!_OS 21.10

Pop!\_OS 21.10 introduced a new UI for the `Applications` menu.

By default, all apps installed are shown in alphabetical order. Application folders are grouped along the bottom of the window. New folders can be created, and apps can be dragged into, or out of folders.

If a folder is deleted, all applications in the folder revert to their original location and alphabetical order in the main menu.

As in previous versions a search box is provided which can search installed applications, or applications to install from the [Pop!\_Shop](#pop_shop-app-installation).

Individual applications will have variations in their sub-menus. Many applications have a menu button located in the top-right or left of the application window. This menu button is usually represented by either three stacked vertical lines (as pictured below, sometimes called the "hamburger" menu), or three vertical dots.
