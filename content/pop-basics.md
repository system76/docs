Welcome to the Pop!_OS desktop! The Pop!_OS operating system provides all the features you would expect from a modern desktop. The basic elements are outlined below.

## Pop!_OS COSMIC Desktop Environment

Pop!\_OS 24.04 includes the COSMIC Desktop environment. COSMIC is written in the rust programming language and is an acronym for _Computer Operating System Main Interface Components_.

## The Launcher

The <u>Launcher</u> is the software responsible for accessing and opening applications and files.

_This video demonstrates the powerful funcationality of the COSMIC Desktop launcher._

To open the launcher press the <kbd>SUPER</kbd> key, which is usually located between `Fn` and `Alt` keys and may have an icon with a window on it. You can also click the launcher magnifying glass icon in the dock.

To switch between open applications you can click, or arrow down, the list of applications in the Launcher window and press `Enter`. Keyboard shortcuts to launch the application are listed to the right of the application name in the launcher.

- File Search: Find files by typing `find` and the search term or file name then select the result in the launcher.
- Internet Search: Search Google or DuckDuckGo within the launcher. Type `google` or `duckduckgo` in the launcher with the search term, then press enter. The default web browser will open with the search results.

## COSMIC Dock

By default, the <u>Dock</u> is the bottom bar on the desktop conisting of application icons, called applets. To customize the dock, as well as other aspects of the look and feel of the Pop!\_OS desktop environment, navigate to `Settings` -> `Desktop`. To change settings for the dock select the `Dock` submenu.

## COSMIC Panel

In the default settings, the <u>Panel</u> is the top bar of the desktop that includes the clock and other icons to access various settings. The components of the panel are also called applets, like the dock has. The panel applets can be used to adjust various settings like volume, bluetooth and accessibility or to connect to WiFi networks, change power or graphics settings and log out/restart/shut down the computer. Quick access to applications can also be added to the panel.

Open COSMIC Settings and click `Desktop` then select `Panel` to customize behavior, style and placement of applets. The panel settings include the same options as the dock settings.

Individual applications will have variations in their sub-menus. Many applications have a menu button located in the top-right or left of the application window for application-specific settings and functions. This menu button is usually represented by either three stacked vertical lines or three vertical dots, sometimes referred to as the 'hamburger menu.'

Default applications included with Pop!_OS 24.04 are outlined in [this article](/articles/default-apps).
