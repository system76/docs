# Pop!_OS Refresh OS Feature

The **Refresh OS** feature reinstalls the operating system without deleting the files in the users's `/home` folder. This allows users to “refresh” the operating system without losing data. This option is useful when:

- You have broken sources and are unable to upgrade Pop!\_OS. Refresh OS can be much faster than untangling dependency conflicts.
- A full “reset” is required without losing user login or `/home` folder data.

>**Note**: Pop!_OS refreshes itself using a backup of the Pop!\_OS.iso file located in the Recovery Partition. It's important that you keep this partition up to date.

The Refresh OS feature can be accessed from three locations: 

- [Settings -> OS Upgrade and Recovery]()
- [The Install screen when booting from a live USB]()
- [In Recovery mode]()

## Refresh OS from Settings

1. Navigate to Settings -> OS Upgrade and Recovery to access the Refresh Install option.
2. If required, update the recovery partition.
3. Click `Refresh OS`.
