CodeWeavers was founded in 1996 during the advent of Linux with the goal of 
making desktop Linux more accessible to end users. We spoke with CodeWeavers 
President James Ramey to learn more about the company’s journey over the last 
23 years, including his use of System76 hardware to help bring CodeWeavers 
products like CrossOver to-market.

> “We started as handful of people on a mission of making Linux more 
> accessible. We’re now a much larger group still pursuing this same mission.”

That larger group now includes 45 employees around the world, approximately 
half of whom are located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. CodeWeavers’ geographically 
diverse team serves an even more diverse user base, spanning consumer, 
business, education, and enterprise markets -- helping all of them run Linux. 

> “Customers have specific programs that they need to do their work. We 
> provide the solution, porting and supporting those applications so they can 
> be used in non-native environments like Linux. We’re helping to make Linux 
> more useful for people switching from other operating systems, and we’re 
> supporting more and more games on the Linux platform as well.”

James is quick to note that, while Linux has excellent native application 
support, there are certain programs that customers are dependent on. Oft-used 
applications such as word processors, desktop email clients, and design and 
engineering software tend to be more difficult to move away from. CrossOver is 
CodeWeavers’ alternative to dual booting or running programs in a virtual 
machine, allowing users to run their favorite programs from a Linux 
environment. 

Despite this dependence on certain programs, CrossOver users at Stanford 
University, MIT, the University of Michigan, and many Fortune 50 companies 
still prefer to use Linux as their overall daily driver. Of course, the team 
at CodeWeavers love Linux too. 

> “Our developers are hardcore Linux users, from custom-built machines to 
> Linux pre-installed machines like System76. We live Linux and understand 
> what Linux users need.“

Over the last year, James has been on a journey to migrate his own work over 
to Linux. Motivated by his curiosity about Linux, frustration with other 
platforms, desire to better understand his Linux customers’ workflows, and 
encouragement by his colleagues at CodeWeavers, James found the transition 
to be seamless.

> “System76 was the first and foremost on my mind, and I’ve been really happy 
> with everything since I switched. The laptop offered all the features (e.g. 
> graphics card, backlit keyboard, display), with all the functionality I 
> expected out of a premium laptop. The system is absolutely spot-on in terms 
> of what I was looking for.

> We look to System76 as being the company making hardware more accessible to 
> the same group of users that we serve. Like System76, we are trying to 
> provide a platform that serves users with a commitment to Linux and open 
> source.”
