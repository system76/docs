# Steam (Install)

### Install Steam From Command Line

Open the <u>Terminal</u> application by searching for <u>Terminal</u> after pressing the Super Key <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'ubuntu']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd>, <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'pop-os']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd>.

Once the <u>Terminal</u> application is opened you can use the Command Line tool `apt` to search for it like so:

```bash
apt search steam
```

Once we find the right name for <u>Steam</u> we can install it with `apt` as well. Please type this command into the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:

```bash
sudo apt install steam
```

**Be very careful when using sudo with ANY Command. It can make system wide changes so be sure to read everything before entering 'Y'.**

Once installed, use the Activities Overview to search for and run <u>Steam</u>.

### Install Steam From the Pop!_Shop

Open the <u>Pop!_Shop</u> application then either search for Steam or by clicking the <u>Steam</u> icon on the Pop!_Shop home page.

#### Enable Steam Play (Proton)

Proton is a way to enable support for some Windows games using Wine and some tweaks and additions that Valve have been working on. You can enable it using the the <u>Steam</u> Settings to download and install Proton.

#### Install Protonup to Manage Custom Proton Versions
<u>Protonup</u> is an easy tool, written in Python, to install the newest-available version of ProtonGE into Steam's proton directory. <u>ProtonGE</u> is a fork of <u>Proton</u>, maintained by GloriousEggroll on Github [here](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom). <u>Protonup</u> is maintained by Naseef in the PyPi project directory [here](https://pypi.org/project/protonup/).

First, we'll need the Python package manager, pip.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Now, let's install protonup via pip, and add it to your `PATH`.

```bash
pip3 install protonup
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now, after <u>Steam</u> is installed, you can run protonup in terminal, and it will grab the newest ProtonGE build. This tool will also pull hotfixes. Below is an example of the tools output:

```bash
protonup
