# System76 Software (Install - Other Operating Systems)

# Notes about these instructions

This section explains how to install the <u>System76 Driver</u> on Arch and Fedora.

**DISCLAIMER**

Except in some rare cases, System76 QA and Engineering teams do not test other OSes on our hardware. This section is provided for informational purposes only.System76 encourages users to take ownership of their machines and install whatever software or operating systems they prefer. 

However, System76 does not guarantee the success or quality of experience when installing other Operating Systems. 
Support typically makes best-efforts to offer direction or troubleshooting for other distributions. 

We may determine that troubleshooting has exceeded the scope of support. If that's the case, further questions should be referred to those Operating System(s)' support forums.

**NOTE:** These instructions were tested on a Galago Pro (galp3-b) and Pangolin (pang10). Neither system have NVIDIA GPUs, so this process doesn't go over installing the NVIDIA driver (system76-driver-nvidia). Due to these limitations, switchable graphics may not work on NVIDIA systems.

# Arch

Be sure to install the <u>System76 Driver</u> first. The steps to do that are [here](/articles/system76-driver). 

## System76 Firmware Daemon

These commands will clone, build and install the <u>System76 Firmware Daemon</u> service.

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-firmware.git
cd system76-firmware-daemon
makepkg -srcif
sudo systemctl enable --now system76-firmware-daemon
sudo gpasswd -a $USER adm
```

## System76 Firmware Manager

These commands will clone, build and install the <u>System76 Firmware Manager</u> application.

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/firmware-manager.git
cd firmware-manager
makepkg -srcif
```

## System76 DKMS

This package is needed for hotkeys and fan(s) on Closed Firmware systems:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-dkms.git
cd system76-dkms
makepkg -srcif
```

## System76 ACPI DKMS

This package is needed for hotkeys and fan(s) on Open Firmware systems:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-acpi-dkms.git
cd system76-acpi-dkms
makepkg -srcif
```

## System76 Power

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-power.git
cd system76-power
makepkg -srcif
sudo systemctl enable --now system76-power
sudo gpasswd -a $USER adm
```

## System76 Power GNOME Shell Extension

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/gnome-shell-extension-system76-power-git.git
cd gnome-shell-extension-system76-power
makepkg -srcif
```

> **NOTE:** As of this writing the GNOME Shell Extension doesn't support GNOME 40.

### System76 Thelio Io DKMS

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-io-dkms.git
cd system76-io-dkms
makepkg -srcif
```

> **NOTE:** This package is only needed for Thelio desktops.

### System76 OLED 

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/system76-oled.git
cd system76-acpi-oled
makepkg -srcif
```

> **NOTE:** This package is only needed for systems with OLED displays to control the brightness.

# Fedora

Be sure to install the <u>System76 Driver</u> first and the steps to do that are [here](/articles/system76-driver). 

## System76 Firmware Manager

Then install the <u>System76 Firmware Manager</u> and the <u>System76 Firmware Daemon</u>,enable the service and add your user to the adm group:

```bash
sudo dnf install firmware-manager
sudo systemctl enable --now system76-firmware-daemon
sudo gpasswd -a $USER adm
```

## System76 Power

Use these commands to install the <u>System76 Power</u> package and enable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable system76-power system76-power-wake 
sudo systemctl start system76-power
```

## System76 Power GNOME Shell Extension

These commands will download the source code for the application, build it, install it and install the <u>Extensions</u> application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pop-os/gnome-shell-extension-system76-power.git
cd gnome-shell-extension-system76-power
sudo dnf install nodejs-typescript
make
make install
```

Now log out and use the <u>Extensions</u> to enable the extenstion. 

## System76 DKMS

These commands will be used to install the <u>System76 DKMS</u> package which is for Proprietary Firmware systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install system76-dkms
sudo systemctl enable dkms
```

## System76 ACPI DKMS

These commands will be used to install the <u>System76 ACPI DKMS</u> package which is for Open Firmware systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install system76-acpi-dkms
sudo systemctl enable dkms
```

> **NOTE:** After enabling the dkms systemd service for either the <u>System76 DKMS</u> or the <u>System76 ACPI DKMS</u> package you will need to reboot the system:

```bash
sudo systemctl reboot
```

### System76 Thelio Io DKMS

This command will be used to install the <u>System76 Io DKMS</u> which is used for the Thelio Io board:

```bash
sudo dnf install system76-io-dkms
```

### System76 OLED

This command will be used to install the <u>System76 OLED</u> which is used for systems with OLED panels:
