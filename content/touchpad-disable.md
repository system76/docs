# Disable Touchpad While Typing

To disable the touchpad while typing, a built-in program needs run. It's best to add it to the startup items to run every time your computer starts. Search for and open <u>Startup Applications</u> from the Dash by pressing the Super Key <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'ubuntu']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd>, <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'pop-os']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd> and then click **Add**.

Field    | Value
---------|------------------------------
Name:    | Syndaemon
Command: | `syndaemon -i 1.0 -K -t -d`
Comment: | Disable touchpad while typing

The `-i 1.0` parameter sets the idle time of the keyboard to 1 second.  
The `-K` ignores the Modifier keys.  
The `-t` only disables tapping and scrolling (leave out to disable all mouse movement).  
The `-d` runs it as a daemon (in the background).  

Click **Add** and then **Close**.  Reboot your computer to enable this setting.

Note: This is a per user setting, so repeat this process for all user accounts.
