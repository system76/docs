## From Pixel/Android to Pop!_OS

### Changing the USB Preference

When you connect your Pixel/Android device to your system there is a notification about USB Preferences which can be reached when you swipe from the top of the screen like the screenshot below:

Once you press on the notification the following screen will appear:

Change "no data transfer" to "File transfer / Android Auto":

### Open the Files application

Next open the <u>Files</u> application and left-click on the Pixel 8 item (in this example it may say the OEM of your device such as Samsung) in the menu on the left side of the window to access the file system on the device.

## From iPhone to Pop!_OS

### Trusting the computer in iOS

First the iPhone must trust your computer which then allows access to the file system on the iPhone. This can be done using the prompt that appears when you connect the iPhone to your system in this screenshot:

### Open the Files application

Next open the <u>Files</u> application and right-click on the iPhone item in the menu on the left side of the window to access the file system on the iPhone.

### Open the DCIM folder/directory

From there you can access your photos based on YEARMONTH such as 201801__ in the screenshot below:
