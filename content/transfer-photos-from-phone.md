Click on the device's name to explore the device's filesystem.

## From iPhone to Pop!\_OS

### Trusting the Computer in iOS

Your iPhone will only allow filesystem access to a trusted computer. When you first connect your iPhone to your computer, a prompt will appear and ask if you want to trust the computer:

### Open the DCIM Directory

The directories inside DCIM are named with the year and month of when the photos inside were taken. For example, "201801__" contains photos that were taken in January of 2018.
