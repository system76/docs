The Ubuntu operating system provides all the features you would expect from a sophisticated desktop.

## Getting to Know the Ubuntu Desktop

Use the Dock on the left side of the screen to start your favorite apps. You can switch between running apps by clicking on their icons. Right click an icon in the Dock to show a menu of actions-- actions include adding or removing application icons from the Dock, opening new windows or tabs, switching between multiple windows of the same app, and more.

## Show Applications

Clicking on the Ubuntu logo in the lower left corner of the screen (on the Dock) will show you all of your installed applications in an app drawer grid.
This screen can also be accessed by pressing <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'ubuntu']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>, <kbd><font-awesome-icon :icon="['fab', 'pop-os']"></font-awesome-icon></kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Super</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>.

## Application Window Menu

Many applications also have in-window menus for adjusting settings, switching to full-screen, etc. The application menu button is often shown as three lines (commonly known as the "hamburger menu").
