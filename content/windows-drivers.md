# Windows Drivers

Most of the hardware in a System76 computer is Intel based, and Windows Update is rather effective at finding drivers. We also recommend using Intel's Driver Update utility, which will automatically detect and install drivers for Intel hardware.

For systems with NVIDIA graphics cards, drivers can be found on their website:

Our laptops and desktops use Intel WiFi, which should be found by the Intel Driver Update utility.  

If there is a missing driver in the <u>Device Manager</u>, right click on the item with the missing driver, choose **Properties**, then **Details**, and then **Hardware Ids** from the drop-down.  The VEN (vendor) and DEV (device) numbers are unique to every piece of hardware.  Search for the device at the PCI Database:

[PCI Lookup](http://www.pcilookup.com/)

You can use that info to find the manufacturer, then search for drivers.
