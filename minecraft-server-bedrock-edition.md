Hello again! It's another beautiful morning in Minecraft! This is how to get Creeper Awww manned in Bedrock Edition on your own server.
While you can't run bedrock edition on your machine, you'll want to set up your own server if you want to avoid getting scammed by Minecraft Realms or similar hosting companies.
C++ isn't as resource intensive as Java, so you can run this on a high level on a Jackel 1 Server, a Thelio Mini, or for <50 players, a System76 Mini.
I've gotten good results off a Raspberry Pi 4.
  
### Debian and Ubuntu

Just get the script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRemote/MinecraftBedrockServer/master/SetupMinecraft.sh
chmod +x SetupMinecraft.sh
./SetupMinecraft.sh 
```
